# Python-Project-Bachelor
In this project i had to develop a code that would allow the user to have a clients list with their name, dna sequence, contacts (multiple if need be), save the data to a determined format, delete information, and accessing to the clients list and information. I was able to do about 90-95% of the project. It also had a small menu where the user could do all these actions
